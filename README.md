```

# Quick start

Launch the application from the Windows search bar:

You must first use the "Create Folder" function. Then, adjust the settings based on the Field of View (FOV).

Merged .tiff files can be split and renamed using the "Split and Rename" function.
The resulting filenames will follow this format:

Where:

FOV: Field of view in Âµm (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4â€¦)

DETECTOR: Type of detector used (e.g., BSE, SE1, SE2, etc.)
